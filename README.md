# valuechecker-lab
A project containing a toy smart contract to be used with the Remix IDE.

All scripts work fine if run against the smart contract deployed at address 0xD073C53d1C2706994C9Aa72106232DBe565923d1 on Ropsten, 
while some of them tend to fail if run inside the Remix's JavaScript VM.

Make sure you have proper access to Ropsten through MetaMask.
