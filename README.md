# valuechecker-lab
A project containing a toy smart contract to be used with the Remix IDE.

All scripts work fine if executed with respect to the smart contract deployed on Ropsten at address 0xD073C53d1C2706994C9Aa72106232DBe565923d1 , 
while some of them tend to fail if executed inside the Remix's JavaScript VM.

Make sure you have proper access to Ropsten through MetaMask.
