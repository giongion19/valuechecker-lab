# valuechecker-lab
A project containing a toy smart contract to be used with the Remix IDE.

All scripts work fine if run against the smart contract deployed at address 0xc3dfbf2624c1CCaAE7218958e4b5D76928503691 on Ropsten, 
while some of them tend to fail if run inside the Remix's JavaScript VM.

Make sure you have proper access to Ropsten through MetaMask.
