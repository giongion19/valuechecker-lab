# valuechecker-lab
A project containing a toy smart contract to be used with the Remix IDE.

All scripts work fine if executed with respect to the smart contract deployed on Goerli at address 0x33d0757f85ad28E865406B605F226e186e2F61C5, 
while some of them tend to fail if executed inside the Remix's JavaScript VM.

Make sure you have proper access to Ropsten through MetaMask.
